        Alliance Residential, LLC. For Labor Code Violations</h2>
</section>

<section class="main-content">
    <p>
        Yoon Law, APC and Justice Law Corporation have filed a putative class action lawsuit against Alliance
        Residential, LLC (“Alliance”) in Sacramento County Superior Court.
    </p>

    <h3>This is not a lawsuit against you; you are not being sued.</h3>

    <p>
        The lawsuit alleges that Alliance illegally denied its on-site non-exempt employees in California
        <strong>all wages owed, including overtime wages, minimum wages, premium wages for working through rest and meal
            breaks and failed to
            reimburse for business related expenses.</strong> The case was filed on behalf of all current and former
        hourly-paid or non-exempt
        on-site employees who worked for Alliance in California any time since August 26, 2012.
    </p>

    <h3>WE NEED YOUR SIGNED AUTHORIZATION</h3>

    <p>
        We believe the company violates California law by not providing breaks, having employees work without being paid
        (for example, working while not “on the clock”), knowingly pressuring employees to skip meals and breaks, to
        incur unreimbursed expenses for the benefit of Alliance (like cell phone usage), and are looking for people
        willing to authorize us to get their records.
    </p>

    <p>
        We would like to request time and payroll records from Alliance because this will assist us in proving our case,
        which will benefit everyone including you. To get your records, we need your written authorization.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you have any information or have information you would like to share, please call us.

    <p>
        We are experienced in handling these types of cases and have successfully prosecuted many similar cases as class
        actions. Both state and federal courts have certified other class actions like this one. However, other courts
        have declined to certify these kinds of cases. Thus, your input at this stage is very important to the case so
        we can make sure the Court is fully informed of the facts.
    </p>

    <h3>ATTENTION</h3>

    <p>
        Alliance has hired the law firm of Fisher & Phillips LLP, to defend the corporation. The corporation’s attorneys
        and/or investigators may contact you to investigate your experiences, observations and beliefs as an Alliance
        employee. Furthermore, the corporation's attorneys have and may attempt to obtain written statements from
        current and former employees regarding the issues in this lawsuit. If you choose to speak with the corporation's
        representatives, please remember that they do not represent your interests as a potential class member. Rather,
        they have a fiduciary obligation to defend the corporation by defeating and/or reducing the value of your
        claims. Anything you say to the corporation’s attorneys could be used against you in court to minimize the value
        of your claims, or to defeat your claims altogether.
    </p>

    <p>
        Attorneys at the Justice Law Corporation and Yoon Law, APC have a duty to represent the best interests of the
        hourly employees who are members of the proposed class by obtaining, among other things, the overtime wages,
        minimum wages, premium wages and unreimbursed expenses owed to them under the law.
    </p>

    <h3>INVESTIGATION AND CASE STATUS</h3>

    <p>
        Both sides are preparing for a hearing to determine whether the case should proceed forward as a class action.
        We must show the Court that common factual issues exist as to all on-site non-exempt employees in California for
        the case to move ahead as a class action.
    </p>

    <p>
        We have written to you both because we assume you would like to know about this lawsuit and because we would
        like to speak with any current or former hourly employee about their experiences working for Alliance. On the
        other hand, we don’t want to bother anyone who is not interested in the case. Please let us know if you do, or
        do not, want to receive more information about the case, including periodic updates on the progress of the case,
        by either calling us at the above-listed phone numbers or emailing us at <a href="mailto:kyoon@yoonlaw.com">kyoon@yoonlaw.com</a>
        or <a href="mailto:dhan@justicelawcorp.com">dhan@justicelawcorp.com</a>. If you tell us that you do not wish to
        be contacted again about this case then we will respect your wishes. You may unsubscribe as well.
