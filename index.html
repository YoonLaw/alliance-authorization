        Pinnacle Claims Management, Inc. For Labor Code Violations</h2>
</section>

<section class="main-content">
    <p>
        We have filed a putative class action lawsuit against Alliance Residential, LLC (“Alliance”) in Sacramento
        County Superior Court.
    </p>

    <h3>This is not a lawsuit against you; you are not being sued.</h3>

    <p>
        The lawsuit alleges that Alliance illegally denied its on-site non-exempt employees in California all wages
        owed,
        including overtime wages, minimum wages, premium wages for working through rest and meal breaks and failed to
        reimburse
        for business related expenses. The case was filed on behalf of all current and former hourly-paid or non-exempt
        on-site
        employees who worked for Alliance in California any time since August 26, 2012.
    </p>

    <h3>WE NEED YOUR SIGNED AUTHORIZATION</h3>

    <p>
        We believe the company violates California law by not providing breaks, having employees work without being paid
        (for example, working while not “on the clock”). We believe Alliance knowingly pressures employees to skip meals
        and breaks, to work without being paid for it, to incur unreimbursed expenses for the benefit of Alliance (like
        cell phone usage), and are looking for people willing to authorize us to get their records.
    </p>

    <p>
        We would like to request time and payroll records from Alliance because this will assist us in proving our case,
        which will benefit everyone including you. To get your records, we need your written authorization.
    </p>

    <p>
        So, to help make sure you get paid if we win, you need to send us back your written authorization.
    </p>

    <h3>WE NEED PERSONNEL RECORDS TOO</h3>

    <p>
        Pinnacle claims that employees could take second meal breaks or signed second meal period waivers. We need
        personnel records to
        establish that Pinnacle employees did not take breaks and did not sign waivers. We also believe that Pinnacle
        retaliated against
        employees who complained about the company’s pay and meal break practices. We are looking for people who
        received write-ups for
        complaining. That’s why we are asking for performance records and documents you signed (write-ups usually
        require acknowledgement
        by the employee).
    </p>

    <h3>THE JACKSON LEWIS LAW FIRM REPRESENTS PINNACLE</h3>

    <p>
        Pinnacle has hired the law firm of Jackson Lewis, P.C. to defend the corporation. The corporation’s lawyers or
        investigators
        may contact you to seek information to help Pinnacle win. They might try to get written statements from current
        and former
        employees regarding the issues in this lawsuit and even offer money to settle this case. If you choose to speak
        to the corporation’s
        representatives, please remember they do not represent your interests as an aggrieved employee. Rather, they
        have a duty to defend
        the corporation by outright defeating this lawsuit and/or reducing the value of your recovery. Everything you
        say to the corporation’s
        attorneys could be used for their goal: defeating the lawsuit and/or reducing your recovery.
    </p>

    <h3>CASE STATUS</h3>

    <p>
        The Court has not yet set a trial date. But your input is still very important to the case, to help us win at
        trial and make sure you get paid if we do win.
    </p>

    <p>
        We are experienced in handling these types of cases and have successfully prosecuted many similar cases as class
        actions and are
        fighting several similar cases under the same Private Attorney General Act.
    </p>

    <p>
        We must show the Court that employees were harmed by Pinnacle’s policies and practices that violated California
        meal break laws, rest
        break laws, minimum wage laws and overtime laws.
    </p>

    <p>
        We have written to your because we assume you would like to know about this lawsuit and because we would like to
        speak with any
        current or former hourly paid employees about their experiences working for Pinnacle. On the other hand, we
        don’t want to bother
        anyone who is not interested. Please let us know if you do or do not want to receive more information about the
        case, including
        updates on the progress of the case, by either calling us or emailing us. If you tell us you don’t want to be
        contacted, we will
        note that in our records and respect your wishes.
    </p>
